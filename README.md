# Stone and Paper

Have you ever played "rock, paper, scissors"? It's a fun and simple game that can be called in different ways, like "jan-ken-pon" or "horn, foot, scissors" (that last one is quite curious, isn't it?). The objective is to beat your opponent by choosing one of three items (rock, paper or scissors) and showing it at the same time as him. Rock beats scissors (because it crushes it), scissors beats paper (because it tears it) and paper beats rock (because it involves it).
